               Running outdoors in the mountains is my favorite thing to do
             , thereâ€™s nothing like that sense of wonder I get every time I explore new places/trails.
             - **Go-to running trail**: I like to connect White Pine lake and Red Pine Lake in Little Cottonwood Canyon
             , I never get tired of the amazing views you get along the way. 
             - **When I'm not running, you can find me**: Sketching or journaling at local coffee shops.

             - **Why I run?**: At first, I started running solely for my mental health. I needed something that I didn't have to think too much about but would allow me to move freely. It soon becameÂ something that was freeing and a personal meditation. It has been a roller coaster with developing asthma as an adult and severe knee pain. However, slowly but surely, I have been able to improve both my physical and mental health with running. 
               It has become an important part of my life that motivates me to take care of myself and be a part of a welcoming community.Â 
             - **Go-to running trail**: You can find me at Liberty Park or City Creek trail!
             - **When I'm not running, you can find me**: When I'm not running, I'm either traveling, hanging out with friends, playing Minecraft, or trying new restaurants. :)
